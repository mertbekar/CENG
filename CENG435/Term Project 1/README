This project includes 21 files.

There are 5 python scripts for nodes. We create and implement 's.py' for source node, 'b.py' for broker node, 'r1.py' for router 1 node, 'r2.py' for router 2 node and 'd.py' for destination node. This project are executed with 3 steps.

Step 1: Connect to machines, put the files into these machines and set delays according to topology.
	Setting Delays For Experiment 1:
			Run following commands on 'b' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 root netem delay 1ms 5ms distribution normal"
								"sudo tc qdisc add dev eth3 root netem delay 1ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc add dev eth1 root netem delay 1ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc add dev eth2 root netem delay 1ms 5ms distribution normal"
	Setting Delays For Experiment 2:
			Run following commands on 'b' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth1 root netem delay 20ms 5ms distribution normal"
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth3 root netem delay 20ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth1 root netem delay 20ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth2 root netem delay 20ms 5ms distribution normal"
	Setting Delays For Experiment 3:
			Run following commands on 'b' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth1 root netem delay 60ms 5ms distribution normal"
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth3 root netem delay 60ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth1 root netem delay 60ms 5ms distribution normal"
			Run following commands on 'r1' machine:
								"sudo tc qdisc change dev eth2 root netem delay 60ms 5ms distribution normal"
Step 2: Synchronize times of machines.
	To synchronize time of machines, run following commands on 's' and 'd' machines:
											"sudo service ntp stop"
											"sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov"
											"sudo service ntp start"
Step 3: Execute python scripts.
	For destination node, run following command on 'd' machine: "python d.py"
	For router 2 node, run following command on 'r2' machine: "python r2.py"
	For router 1 node, run following command on 'r1' machine: "python r1.py"
	For broker node, run following command on 'b' machine: "python b.py"
	For source node, run following command on 's' machine: "python s.py"
		Important Note: Order of these commands not important except for source node. The command of source node should be executed last order.

There are 3 '.csv' files named "delays_1.csv", "delays_20.csv" and "delays_60.csv". These files stores end-to-end delays for each packet respectively experiment 1, experiment 2 and experiment 3. We create these files to construct histogram file for each experiment.

There are 3 '.csv' files named "histogram_1.csv", "histogram_20.csv" and "histogram_60.csv". These files stores packet count for each end-to-end delay value respectively experiment 1, experiment 2 and experiment 3. We create these files to construct histograms for each experiment.

There are 2 python scripts named "histogram.py" and "vs_graph.py". The script which named "histogram.py" creates histogram graphs for experiments. The other script which named "vs_graph.py" creates "Network Emulation Delay versus End-To-End Delay" graphs for exeriments

There are 5 '.png' files for graphs. Also, there is a '.tex' file named "main.tex" for the project report. We use "overleaf" for create and fill this '.tex' file.

Last two files are "TP_Part1_17" which is report of this part of term project and this file, "README".
